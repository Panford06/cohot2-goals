# Goals for Slightly Techie Backend Track

By the end of the course, I expect to have gained the following:

- __Understand Python syntax better__. I expect to understand anything python that hase been written and know what that code is about.

- __Contribute to Open Source__. I expect that I would be able to contribute to ongoing open source projects to gain hands-on experience to prepare me for work life.

- __Take on real life mini/midi projects__. By so doing, I would be able to make some momey from writing code. At this point, I start making it as a __techie__.
